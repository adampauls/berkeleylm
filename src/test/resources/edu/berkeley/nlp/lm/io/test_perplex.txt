japanese telecommunications giant nippon telegraph and telephone corp. officially launched a major corporate reorganization thursday , company officials said .
ntt has turned itself into a holding company and split its business operations into two regional telephone companies and one long-distance and international one , ntt spokesman kazuhiko nishizawa said .
the move marks part of a major overhaul in japan 's once highly regulated phone and communications industry .
ntt is the world 's second largest telecommunications company after at and t of the united states .
under the reorganization , the holding company oversees nippon telegraph and telephone east corp. covering eastern japan , and nippon telegraph and telephone west corp. in the western half of the country , nishizawa said .
it also manages ntt communications corp. , a long-distance and international carrier , he added .
japan 's ministry of posts and telecommunications announced ntt 's breakup in 1996 .
the company long had a virtual monopoly on local phone services .
in recent years , a host of new companies offering both domestic and international phone service have entered the market .

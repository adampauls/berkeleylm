japanese telecommunications giant nippon telegraph and telephone corp. officially launched a major corporate reorganization thursday , company officials said .
ntt has turned itself into a holding company and split its business operations into two regional telephone companies and one long-distance and international one , ntt spokesman kazuhiko nishizawa said .
the move marks part of a major overhaul in japan 's once highly regulated phone and communications industry .
ntt is the world 's second largest telecommunications company after at and t of the united states .
under the reorganization , the holding company oversees nippon telegraph and telephone east corp. covering eastern japan , and nippon telegraph and telephone west corp. in the western half of the country , nishizawa said .
it also manages ntt communications corp. , a long-distance and international carrier , he added .
japan 's ministry of posts and telecommunications announced ntt 's breakup in 1996 .
the company long had a virtual monopoly on local phone services .
in recent years , a host of new companies offering both domestic and international phone service have entered the market .
investors appeared to welcome the new look .
thursday morning , shares of ntt rose to their highest level since december 1989 on the tokyo stock exchange , climbing as high as 1.48 million yen ( dlrs 12,242 ) a share .
separately , ntt data corp. and ntt mobile communications network inc .
, commonly known as ntt docomo , said wednesday they have agreed to work together in the internet service provider business . ( gp-dj )

ann kristin aarones used her height advantage to head in an early second half goal to propel defending champion norway to a 3-1 victory over sweden wednesday night in a women 's world cup quarterfinal match .
norway , which has been a finalist in each of the first two women 's world cups , will face china in a semifinal match sunday at foxboro , massachusetts .
earlier wednesday , china defeated russia 2-0 in a quarterfinal match , outshooting the russians 24-2 .
the norwegians and swedes , neighbors and frequent opponents in women 's soccer , played a scoreless first half befitting a match between familiar rivals .
at an imposing 6 feet ( 1.83 meters ) , aarones was the tallest woman on the field by several inches ( centimeters ) , and when she jumped , the norwegian midfielder towered over the swedish defenders .
early in the second half , she used every inch ( centimeter ) of that advantage to head in a goal .
silje jorgensen sent a free kick high into the swedish penalty area . aarones leaped for the ball and struck it with the right side of her forehead , sending a shot skipping past swedish goalie ulrika karlsson in the 51st minute .
a bare-chested male fan wearing a viking hat ran through the stands in celebration as norwegian flags fluttered among the crowd of 21,411 , about 5,000 short of capacity .
things quickly got worse for karlsson and the rest of the swedes .
the swedish goalie was stunned in the 55th minute after a collision that earned norwegian substitute solveig gulbrandsen a yellow card .
three minutes later , norway 's marianne pettersen faked out two defenders and lofted a soft shot that floated over karlsson and landed in the corner of the net .
a few minutes later , the norwegians were awarded a penalty kick when karlsson tripped pettersen near the net .
hege riise converted the penalty , making it 3-0 .
the swedes avoided a shutout when malin mostrom scored in injury time at the end of the second half .
with protesters chanting nearby , chinese vice president hu jintao unveiled a black " unification monument " thursday and proclaimed hong kong has stayed prosperous and free in the two years since its return to china from britain .
" hong kong people can absolutely manage hong kong well , " hu told an audience of dignitaries including hong kong chief executive tung chee-hwa .
" hong kong has kept its social and financial systems that have been in place , and its way of living has not been changed . "
as hu spoke , chants of dissent were audible from just outside the ceremony .
two small groups of demonstrators were loudly demanding an end to china 's one-party communist system and the release of political prisoners .
and as hong kong enters its third year as part of china , many ordinary citizens have their doubts about how well things are going .
the anniversary of hong kong 's july 1 , 1997 , handover is now a public holiday .
but few hong kong people were celebrating amid a drawn-out recession and accusations that the affluent territory is fast surrendering its autonomy .
" what 's there to celebrate ? they are wasting our money on the celebrations , " said lau kam-wah , a retiree who was out walking early thursday .
security was tight around hu 's appearances , which also included a flag-raising ceremony .
but anti-china protesters insisted on being heard , as officials marked the day with hoopla including a boat parade and a formation of helicopters that flew past , towing the chinese and hong kong flags through the skies over victoria harbor .
in demonstrations that would not be permitted on the mainland , activists chanted for amnesty for political prisoners , including those jailed 10 years ago after the tiananmen square pro-democracy demonstrations in beijing were crushed by armed forces .
" the butchers ' regime must step down , " said one banner .
the protesters scuffled with police and were blocked from getting too close to the waterfront monument ceremony .
police later confiscated their megaphones , saying they were responding to residents ' complaints of noise . no one was arrested .
hong kong was reunited with china at the height of its financial prowess after 156 years of british rule .
the tiny territory , now china 's " special administrative region , " has kept the free-market economy and the british-style judiciary and civil service under a formula dubbed " one country , two systems , " which guarantees hong kong autonomy .
but not many people are convinced that the promises are being met .
" hong kong is being controlled by beijing , " said macon wong , an accountant .
" things are changing faster than i anticipated . "
most people agree that beijing has largely kept to its hands-off pledge , but critics say hong kong is chipping away at its own independence _ for example by asking for beijing 's help in a recent legal dilemma .
hong kong 's court of final appeal ruled in january that hong kong 's mini-constitution , called the basic law , granted hong kong residency to any mainland chinese with one hong kong parent , even if the parent gained residency after the child was born .
fearing a migrant influx would stretch hong kong 's resources past their limits , hong kong deferred to beijing 's authority and asked chinese lawmakers to pass a final judgment on what the constitution was intended to say about such immigrants .
the chinese congress ruled saturday that hong kong 's justices had erred in their ruling _ a decision that could cut the number of potential immigrants over the next decade from 1.6 million to about 200,000 .
" the ' two systems ' are being blurred , " said lawmaker martin lee , leader of the opposition democratic party .
" the ' one country ' is more important than ' two systems . " '
south korea 's president demanded stricter safety standards thursday in the wake of a blaze that took the lives of 19 children and four adults in a summer camp dormitory made of shipping containers .
as police began an investigation , parents and teachers were already squarely placing the blame on the owner of the camp , who built the hazardous , sub-standard dormitory in apparent violation of building codes .
" there will be a thorough investigation and punishment , " president kim dae-jung said .
" stricter measures must be taken to strengthen safety standards , especially for facilities used by children . "
police said kim yong-se , 26 , the owner of the sealand youth training center , could face criminal charges in the fire .
he was taken into custody for questioning .
police said they also were issuing arrest warrants for two structural engineers involved in the construction of the camp .
also facing investigation were local government officials who licensed the facility .
the death toll from the fire wednesday was revised to 19 children and four adults .
government forensic officials had earlier said 21 children and two adults were dead .
two children and a teacher were also injured in the fire that swept the three-story dormitory at the camp in hwasung , 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) southwest of seoul .
the first floor of the gutted dormitory was a concrete block structure , on which 54 freight containers were stacked to make two upper floors .
styrofoam , wood blocks and other flammable materials were also used to build the dormitory , which collapsed into charred ruins before firefighters could contain the blaze .
" once they get heated , such structures can spread fire very rapidly , in most cases out of control , " said kim ji-su , a former fireman who now runs a construction and fire safety consulting business .
police said an electrical short-circuit may have caused the fire .
" these kids died because of adults ' carelessness .
this horrible tragedy should never happen again , " said koh suk , 37 , a pharmaceutical company executive , who lost 6-year-old twin daughters .
" we want to know the causes .
we can 't understand how come a camp accommodating 600 kids didn 't have proper fire-extinguishing systems , how this facility could get a government license . we want explanations , " he said .
the blaze broke out in a third-floor room where 18 children from one kindergarten in seoul were asleep .
all were trapped inside and died . one child and four adults also died in two different third-floor rooms .
more than 400 children and teachers in the lower floors scrambled to get out but were hampered by a long , narrow corridor stretching 50 meters ( yards ) , the length of the dormitory .
there were only two outside stair-cases on each end of the building .
some children tripped and tumbled down the stairs as they were rushed out by teachers , witnesses said .
a makeshift mourning altar was set up at a government building in seoul .
wailing mothers and grandmothers hugged and touched photos of the dead children framed with white chrysanthemums , the traditional funeral flower in south korea . a few mothers fainted and had to be carried out by relatives .
about 450 kindergarten and elementary school children and their teachers were attending a two-day recreational program at the camp overlooking the yellow sea on south korea 's west coast .
with all of the victims burned beyond recognition , teachers and center staff had to conduct a roll call of survivors before parents of the dead could be notified .
all bodies were brought to a national scientific investigation center in seoul for identification .
center officials said most would require dna and forensic tests .
prime minister mahathir mohamad flew into the home state of fallen protege anwar ibrahim thursday , making his first stop on a nationwide meet-the-people tour .
mahathir , along with his deputy abdullah ahmad badawi and other top party strategists , began meetings with state-level leaders at a golf club in the northern malaysian state of penang .
although he has not yet called an election , mahathir began rallying his party last month .
once a vote is announced , the leader will face a tough challenge from the once-fragmented opposition that has banded together since anwar 's sacking and arrest last september .
the term of the present government runs until june 2000 , but mahathir is expected to call an early election to catch the opposition off guard .
many observers predict a general vote later this year .
former deputy prime minister anwar is serving a six-year prison sentence for abuse of power .
he is also on trial for sodomy , a crime in mostly muslim malaysia .
anwar denies the charges against him , saying he was fired to stem his challenge to mahathir .
the 73-year-old prime minister has said repeatedly he was not behind any conspiracy against his former protege .
in penang , local leaders of mahathir 's ruling united malays national organization have worked for days to ensure huge crowds showed up at rallies planned for later thursday .
a show of strength in penang is crucial for mahathir because it would prove that he is popular in a state where anwar won successive elections in the past .
since anwar 's wife azizah ismail formed her national justice party earlier this year , she has held several rallies in penang .
while she was there , huge crowds turned up to hear her talk about the cruel manner in which mahathir treated her husband and about the need for political reform and an end to mahathir 's 18-year grip on power .

u.s. president bill clinton pleaded with the british and irish on wednesday to " give peace a chance , " as they worked into the night to save the northern ireland peace pact .
clinton talked twice with british prime minister tony blair _ both before and after a fund-raising dinner here .
each call lasted about 10 minutes . white house spokesman joe lockhart declined to characterize the conversation , except to say that blair gave clinton an update on the talks .
returning to washington as the talks were adjourned until friday , clinton also spoke from air force one with ulster unionist leader david trimble and sinn fein-ira leader gerry adams , lockhart said .
" the president made the point to both of them that they need to stay the course and resolve this because it 's too late to turn back now , " lockhart said .
he said the conversations were " substantive " and dealt with relevant issues , but he would not specify them .

unidentified gunmen raided the home of a moderate tamil lawmaker and killed two of his guards , police and witnesses said thursday .
the deputy , b. balachandran , had left his home for colombo , the sri lankan capital , hours before the attack on wednesday .
" i heard rapid gunfire , " said m. balachandran , his wife .
" it stopped after a minute and when we checked we saw two of our guards dead . "
the attack occurred at balachandran 's home in vavuniya , a tamil-majority town 210 kilometers ( 130 miles ) north of colombo .
balachandran couldn 't be reached for comments .
he survived a similar attack last year . he was at home but the gunmen fled when challenged by his armed guards . one guard was killed in the attack .
balachandran belongs to the people 's liberation organization of tamil eelam , or plote , one of a dozen former rebel groups which gave up the armed struggle against the government to take part in the political system .
the government has allowed the groups to keep arms to fight the tamil tiger rebels , who have targeted moderate tamils .
the tamil tigers have been fighting for an independent homeland for sri lanka 's tamil minority since 1983 , saying they face discrimination by the majority sinhalese .
the government denies the charge . more than 58,000 people have died in the fighting .
prime minister john howard said thursday he had wanted australian police in the indonesian province of east timor to be armed , but was persuaded they would be safer without weapons .
australian police and other united nations personnel were attacked by more than 100 anti-independence militia members in maliana in east timor on tuesday .
